# Dice-Mult
A plugin that adds a dice roll-based damage system for skills and items. 
Supports custom multipliers and dice sides via notetags, displays the roll in the battle log, and stores roll and damage values in game variables.

Both the setup and modification details are in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Minotaur215/Dice-Mult/wiki) page.
