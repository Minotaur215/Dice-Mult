# Dice-Mult
A plugin that adds a dice roll-based random multiplier for skills and items. 
Supports random state application and dice side manipulation via notetags, displays the roll in the battle log, and stores roll and boosted stat values in in game variables.

Both the setup and modification details are in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Minotaur215/Dice-Mult/wiki/Setup-and-Modifications) page.
